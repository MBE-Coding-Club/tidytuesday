#first try - tried to look at the top states for beer production for each year, and then wanted to make a graph for each year and top 10 states. Gave up after 2008
```{r}

year2008 <- beer_states %>% 
  select(state, year, barrels) %>% 
  filter(state != "total") %>% 
  arrange(desc(barrels)) %>% 
  filter(year == 2008) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(barrels)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total)) 

ggplot(data=year2008) + 
  geom_col(aes(x=state, y = total))

#take 2 - found this cool code to look at percent change in production over time on a map! I take no credit for this.
