## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
income_distribution <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/income_distribution.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }

test <- filter(income_distribution, income_bracket == "Under $15,000")
test2 <- filter(test, race == "All Races")
test3 <- filter(income_distribution, income_bracket == "$200,000 and over")
test4 <- filter(test3, race == "All Races")

t <- rbind(test2, test4)

ggplot(t, aes(year, income_distribution))+geom_line(aes(color = income_bracket)) +
  xlab("year") + ylab("% of overall income controlled") + ggtitle("The change of wealth distribution over time")

i_d <- filter(income_distribution, income_bracket %in% c("$200,000 and over", "Under $15,000"))

ggplot(i_d, aes(year, income_distribution)) + geom_point(aes(color = income_bracket)) #+ facet_grid(aes(race))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
